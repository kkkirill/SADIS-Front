                London is the capital of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan
                area of over 13 million inhabitants
                Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back
                to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.
                London is considered to be one of the world's most important global cities and has been termed the world's
                most powerful, most desirable, most influential, most visited, most expensive, innovative, sustainable, most
                investment friendly, and most popular for work city in the world. London exerts a considerable impact upon
                the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services,
                research and development, tourism and transportation. London ranks 26 out of 300 major cities for economic
                performance. It is one of the largest financial centres and has either the fifth or sixth largest
                metropolitan area GDP. It is the most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the busiest
                city airport system as measured by passenger traffic. It is the leading investment destination, hosting more
                international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's universities form
                the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe, and is home of world-class institutions
                such as Imperial College London in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and the London School
                of Economics in economics, finance, and business. In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three
                modern Summer Olympic Games.
